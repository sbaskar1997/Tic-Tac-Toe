To whom it may concern,
This project is just a fun little tic-tac-toe game I made. Feel free to use it to any way you want. If you are using it for profit (which
I doubt) just give me credit. Currently it is only through the command line. I look to add gui and make it a full fledged program, but this
should do for now. If there are any bugs feel free to email me sbaskar@purdue.edu or baskar.sandeep@gmail.com and notify me so I can fix it
as soon as possible.

Thanks and Have Fun!
